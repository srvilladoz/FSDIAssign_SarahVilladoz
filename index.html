        <p> Hi, my name is <mark><b>Sarah</b></mark>. I currently work as <i>Electrical and Instrument Technician</i> at a <u>Food/Chemical Plant</u> in <b>San Diego, CA</b>. I have <i>two</i> cute little <b>dogs</b>, <u>Genie</u> and <u>Pebbles</u>. On my free time, I like to <u><i>bring them to the dog park</i></u> and <u><i>watch them play</i></u>. I also love playing <u><i>tennis</i></u>.</p>
        <br>
        <p> I decided to take this class because I want to <b>gain confidence in coding</b> and <b>build my skills</b> for it. I am not rushing to leave my current job just yet, so I figured right now would probably be the best time to take more classes. </p><br>
        <p>I <b>love</b> <u>studying</u> and <u>learning</u> new things. Last week, I <b>finally</b> <i>completed</i> <u>all</u> of the requirements I need to obtain a degree in <mark><b><i><u>Bachelor of Science in Computer and Electrical Engineering</u></i></b></mark>. It took me <b>four</b> <i>years</i> to finish. </p><br>
        <p>I am also a <mark><b>veteran</b></mark>. I joined the <i>US Navy</i> in 2010 and left active duty in 2017. I was <b>only stationed in San Diego</b> throughout my time in the navy, however, I <i>deployed twice</i> all over Asia for <u>9 months</u> each. I <b>enjoyed</b> my time in the Navy, <u>but</u> it is now time for me to <i>focus</i> on my <b>education</b>.</p>
